The next step is set up a has_many :through relationship between these three models so that we can keep track of who's driving who around. It will work like this:

Taxi -< Rides >- Passengers

taxi has many passengers
passengers has many taxes
taxi has many passengers through Rides
passengers has_many taxis through Rides

This way, a taxi can have many passengers, and a passenger can have many taxis!

`Each table only has a primary key, so you'll need to write a migration to get the database ready to handle the "has_many :through" relationship.
`rails g migrate add_foreign_keys_to_ride
`foreign keys should be taxi_id and passenger_id
 
 model should have has_many
